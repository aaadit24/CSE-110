Fun Fact

**I am second year *Math - CS major***



The programming Languages that I have worked with are:
 - [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
 - [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)
 - [C](https://devdocs.io/c/)
 - [C++](https://devdocs.io/cpp/)
 - [SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/?view=sql-server-ver16)

The favorite ranking of these languages are:
1. Python
2. Java
3. C++
4. C
5. SQL

In Python to print the statement "Hello World" we can type:

```
print ("Hello World")
```

whereas in Java, we have to write;

```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```

My daily checklist before I leave my room is 
- [ ] Wallet
- [ ] Phone
- [ ] Airpods
- [ ] Glasses
